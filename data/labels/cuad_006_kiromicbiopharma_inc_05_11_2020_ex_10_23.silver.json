  "risk_explanation": "The agreement appears to include broad confidentiality and IP/invention assignment obligations and an indemnity obligation, but no explicit limitation of liability or liability cap is shown in the excerpts. Termination is allowed on prior written notice with no stated notice period, creating uncertainty. From a small SaaS vendor perspective, uncapped exposure combined with indemnity and strong IP provisions increases risk."
