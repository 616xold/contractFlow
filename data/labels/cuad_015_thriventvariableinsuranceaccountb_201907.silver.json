  "risk_explanation": "The excerpts describe an insurance/benefit society contract amendment that includes a maintenance-of-solvency provision requiring the member to make an extra payment if the Society’s solvency is impaired, with interest if unpaid. Key commercial protections typical for a small SaaS vendor (governing law, liability cap, termination terms) are not stated in the provided text, increasing uncertainty. The potential for additional payment obligations and lack of clear risk-limiting terms drive a high risk rating."
