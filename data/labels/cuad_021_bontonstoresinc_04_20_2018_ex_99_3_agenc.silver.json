  "risk_explanation": "The excerpts indicate a complex bankruptcy-related wind-down/sale agreement with multiple monetary caps, escrowed deposit/liquidated damages, and extensive operational obligations, which is atypical and high-risk for a small SaaS vendor. Liability and payment structures appear specialized (e.g., trust/segregated accounts and caps) and not a standard SaaS allocation of risk. Key commercial basics like a clear effective date and overall term length are not determinable from the provided excerpts."
