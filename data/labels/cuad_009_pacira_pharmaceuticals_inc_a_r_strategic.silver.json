  "risk_explanation": "The agreement includes broad indemnity/insurance obligations and product-related liabilities, which can create meaningful exposure for a small vendor. Although there is a stated liability limitation, the cap amount is redacted and there are carve-outs, making the true risk difficult to quantify. Governing law and exclusive jurisdiction in New York may also increase dispute-handling burden."
