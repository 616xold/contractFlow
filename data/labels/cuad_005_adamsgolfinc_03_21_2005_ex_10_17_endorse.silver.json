  "risk_explanation": "The agreement includes broad, uncapped indemnity obligations (including attorneys’ fees) and does not state any limitation of liability, which is high risk for a small vendor. Key commercial terms (including parts of the term and payments) are heavily redacted, increasing uncertainty. Termination provisions appear focused on for-cause scenarios with specific notice periods, but no clear termination-for-convenience notice is provided."
