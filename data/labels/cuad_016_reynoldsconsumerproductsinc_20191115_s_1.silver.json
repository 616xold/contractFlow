  "risk_explanation": "This is a master supply agreement with broad limitation-of-liability language (direct damages only; consequential/indirect damages waived) and notable carve-outs that preserve potentially significant exposure for indemnification, IP infringement, and confidentiality breaches. The excerpts do not show a clear monetary liability cap or a termination-for-convenience notice period, which can increase uncertainty for a small SaaS vendor. Governing law is Illinois (US), which may add legal/venue friction for non-US vendors."
