  "risk_level": "medium",
  "risk_explanation": "This is a distribution and services agreement with mutual indemnification provisions tied to securities law disclosures, which can create meaningful litigation and defense-cost exposure. There is no clear monetary cap on liability; instead, liability is limited structurally to the Fund’s property and excludes coverage for willful misfeasance/bad faith/gross negligence. Termination requires notice (60 days by the Fund; 90 days by Integrity), which reduces flexibility compared to at-will termination."
