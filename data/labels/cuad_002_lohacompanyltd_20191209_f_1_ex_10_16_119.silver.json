  "risk_explanation": "This is a supply/framework contract governed by PRC law with arbitration in Beijing, which can increase enforcement and dispute-resolution complexity for a small SaaS vendor. The excerpts do not show any limitation of liability cap or clear termination-for-convenience notice, increasing commercial risk. The agreement also includes operational obligations (e.g., insurance at 110% invoice value, shipment terms, penalties) that suggest potentially significant exposure without a corresponding liability limitation."
