  "risk_explanation": "The agreement appears to be a subcontract/strategic alliance with strong subcontractor obligations, including broad compliance, safety, and indemnity-related responsibilities, plus a 15-day cure period for default termination. There is no clear limitation of liability cap in the excerpts, which increases exposure. It also includes a non-solicitation clause with liquidated damages, adding commercial risk."
