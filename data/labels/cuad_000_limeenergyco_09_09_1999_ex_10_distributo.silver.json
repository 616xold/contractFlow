  "risk_explanation": "This is a long-term (10-year) exclusive distributor agreement, which can create commercial lock-in and operational risk for a small SaaS vendor. The contract includes non-solicitation/non-compete style restrictions (e.g., not soliciting customers to purchase competitive products for 18 months after term). Liability is not clearly capped overall, though there is a limitation excluding consequential/liquidated damages for late delivery unless agreed in writing."
