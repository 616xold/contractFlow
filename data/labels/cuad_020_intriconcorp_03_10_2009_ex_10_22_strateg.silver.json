  "risk_explanation": "This appears to be a technology licensing agreement with broad indemnities and extensive IP/patent-related subject matter, which can create significant exposure for a small vendor. The limitation of liability language shown focuses on excluding indirect/consequential damages but does not clearly state a monetary cap, increasing financial risk. Termination can occur on 3 months’ notice, which may create revenue and planning uncertainty."
