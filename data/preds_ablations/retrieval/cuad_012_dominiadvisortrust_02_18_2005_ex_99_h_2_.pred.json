Liability is heavily limited in favor of the Sponsor (only liable for willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard), which can be unfavorable to a small vendor if roles were reversed. Governing law is Massachusetts, and there are no data transfer or non-solicit protections indicated in the excerpts.",
