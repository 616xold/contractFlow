Liability appears capped to the aggregate fees/expenses owed, which may be unfavorable depending on potential exposure. The term is fixed (April 1, 2019 to March 30, 2020) and governing law/jurisdiction is India (New Delhi), which can add enforcement and dispute-resolution friction for a small SaaS vendor."}
