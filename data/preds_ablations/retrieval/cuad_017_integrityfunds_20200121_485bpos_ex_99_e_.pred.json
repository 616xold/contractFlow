  "risk_explanation": "This is a distribution and services agreement with mutual indemnification provisions tied to securities law disclosures, which can create meaningful litigation and defense-cost exposure. There is no clear monetary liability cap; instead, liability is limited to the Fund’s property and excludes certain misconduct standards, leaving uncertainty for a vendor. Termination requires 60–90 days’ notice, which may reduce flexibility compared to typical SaaS arrangements.",
