Upon the expiration or termination of","snippet":"If Company terminates the Agreement without cause... it shall repurchase... any unopened Product, and shall bear all shipping, handling and related costs"}],"confidence":0.62,"value":"The risk level is driven by termination and inventory exposure: either party can terminate on 30 days’ notice, which can abruptly end the relationship. Repurchase of inventory is largely at the Company’s option and may be at net invoice price less various deductions, creating potential financial loss for the Distributor. However, if the Company terminates without cause (and not due to minimum expectations), it must repurchase unopened product and cover related shipping/handling costs, partially mitigating that risk."}
