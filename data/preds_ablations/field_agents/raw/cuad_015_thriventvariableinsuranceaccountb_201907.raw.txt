If the member does not pay within 60 days, the amount becomes indebtedness against the contract with 5% compounded interest, and the member may instead accept a reduction in benefits. Although the contract states benefits will not be reduced by future bylaw amendments, the solvency clause still creates potential additional cost or benefit reduction risk."}
