Termination is allowed for convenience but requires 60 days' notice, reducing flexibility. The document is a sponsorship/administrative services arrangement rather than a typical SaaS contract, and it lacks common SaaS protections/terms (e.g., data processing and security provisions), increasing operational/legal ambiguity.",
