  "risk_explanation": "This is an amendment/termination of a joint venture agreement rather than a SaaS contract, so many vendor-protective commercial terms (liability cap, termination notice, data processing) are not stated here. It includes survival of liability for pre-closing breaches and D&O indemnity obligations, which can create open-ended exposure. Governing law is Japan, which may increase enforcement and legal-cost risk for a small SaaS vendor.",
