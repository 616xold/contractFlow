  "risk_explanation": "The agreement includes mutual indemnification for third-party claims arising from negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach, but it does not include any express limitation of liability, creating potentially uncapped exposure. Confidentiality obligations extend for five years after termination, and termination for convenience requires 90 days’ notice, which may reduce flexibility. There are no clear data protection or security terms, leaving compliance and operational expectations ambiguous.",
