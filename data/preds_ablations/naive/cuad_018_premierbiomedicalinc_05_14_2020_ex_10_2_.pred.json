  "risk_explanation": "This is an intellectual property licensing/joint venture agreement with significant payment, royalty, and IP prosecution cost obligations, and it lacks typical SaaS protections like a clear liability cap and termination-for-convenience notice. The agreement includes broad confidentiality obligations with no clear time limit and complex reversion/assignment mechanics tied to payment defaults. These factors create high commercial and legal risk for a small SaaS vendor.",
