Liability is capped only for Dynamic Hearing (at $5m) and there are extensive exclusions of implied warranties and consequential damages, creating imbalance depending on which side you are. Termination for convenience requires 3 months’ notice and termination is restricted for the first two years except for non-payment, reducing flexibility.",
