  "risk_explanation": "This is a mutual NDA with standard confidentiality, non-use, and compelled-disclosure provisions, and a defined term (2 years) with confidentiality obligations lasting 5 years. There is no express limitation of liability or other risk-allocation language, which can increase exposure if a dispute arises. The agreement is governed by Massachusetts law with exclusive jurisdiction in Massachusetts courts, which may be unfavorable for a small SaaS vendor outside that forum."
